    <h1>(Acoustic Gutair)</h1> 
    
    <p>An acoustic guitar is a fretted musical instrument that produces sound via vibrating strings above a hollow chamber in the guitar's body. The vibrations carry through the air and do not require electrical amplification (although many acoustic guitars also function as electric guitars). A standard acoustic guitar has six strings. Twelve string guitars are available – these have a rich sound but are usually only used for strumming chords. You may find what you can do with a 12 string guitar rather limiting</p>

    <p>Renaissance and Baroque guitars are the ancestors of the modern classical and flamenco guitar. They are substantially smaller, more delicate in construction, and generate less volume. The strings are paired in courses as in a modern 12-string guitar, but they only have four or five courses of strings rather than six single strings normally used now. They were more often used as rhythm instruments in ensembles than as solo instruments, and can often be seen in that role in early music performances.Gaspar Sanz's Instrucción de Música sobre la Guitarra Española of 1674 contains his whole output for the solo guitar. Renaissance and Baroque guitars are easily distinguished, because the Renaissance guitar is very plain and the Baroque guitar is very ornate, with ivory or wood inlays all over the neck and body, and a paper-cutout inverted "wedding cake" inside the hole.</p>
